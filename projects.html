            <h1>celeste classic gb</h1>
            <p>
              a project to remake the pico-8 version of celeste on the game boy.
              this is also a way for me to learn the gameboy assembly, i thought it would be fun.
              for now it's not even a thing, i try to work on it from time to time.
